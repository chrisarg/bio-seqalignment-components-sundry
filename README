NAME
    Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::Sundry Placeholder for miscellaneous
    components

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::Sundry::ComponentName;

DESCRIPTION
    This module reserves the name space for miscellaneous components that
    are relevant for building awesome sequencing applications using the
    Bio::SeqAlignment framework. The module itself does not provide any
    functionality, so you will have to load the specific components you need
    as you build your application, e.g.:

      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::Sundry::ComponentName;

    where ComponentName is the name of the component you need.

COMPONENTS
    Tailing
        This module provides functions to add various tails to the 3' of
        biological sequences. Such modifications are useful for e.g.
        simulating polyA tails in RNAseq, adding UMI tags to sequences, etc.

    DocumentSequenceModifications
        This module provides functions to store and retrieve sequence
        modifications in various formats. These modifications provide a
        meta-data layer to fasta files (and down the road to fastq files)
        that can be used to track changes made to the sequences in the file.
        While there are many ways to store such information, this module
        provides a simple way to store and retrieve it in common
        serialization formats (e.g. JSON/YAML/MessagePack). Storing this
        information in this manner allows for easy retrieval and use in
        downstream analyses and avoids the use of the rather heavyweight
        BioPerl modules.

    IOHelpers
        This module provides helper functions for reading and writing
        (simple) sequence files. By simple sequence files, we mean files
        that contain only sequence data, such as FASTA (and some time in the
        future FASTQ) files. The module uses the BioX::Seq module to parse
        sequences. This is a simple module that provides a lightweight
        object-oriented interface to sequence data. It is also wickedly
        fast.
